Hi! My name is Amani Hassan

<img src="/img/author.jpg" alt="Author Image" class="about-img" />


Testt I'm a senior at the University of Central Florida pursuing a B.S. in Human Factors Psychology with a Minor in Computer Science & Information Technology. As an aspiring full-stack developer, I specialize in React, Java, and C to bring web applications to life.

My studies in computer science have equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, system design, and problem-solving, while my background in psychology provides insight into user behavior. This unique combination enables me to design accessible, intuitive, and visually engaging UI/UX experiences. Whether Iâ€™m building dynamic front-end interfaces or optimizing back-end systems, my goal is to create digital solutions that are both functional and user-centered.
