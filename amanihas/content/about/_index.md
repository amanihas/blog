Hi! My name is Amani Hassan

<img src="/img/author.jpg" alt="Author Image" class="about-img" />


I'm a student at the University of Central Florida's College of Engineering and Computer Science. I'm an aspiring full-stack developer who primarily works with React, Java, and C.

I'm currently also studying Human Factors Psychology, which serves as a great background for my pursuits in creating accessible and beautiful UI/UX on my webapps.
