In the club I'm a part of, Girls Who Code, I worked together with a team of girls in order to create our own virsion of the popular game, Water Boy and Fire Girl.

We utilized HTML to ensure seamless display on browsers, JavaScript for the game's core code and functionalities, and Tiled for crafting and designing the levels.

We met up once a week during the Spring 2024 semester and worjed together to create the game. Each member designed one of the level for the game using Tiled, an open source level editor. The level picured above is the one I created. 

Throughout the project, we encountered challenges such as properly scaling the game characters to match the dimensions of each level and learning new software, as we were relatively inexperienced in game design. Despite these obstacles, we successfully completed the project and presented our work to other groups, demonstrating the results of our dedication and teamwork.
