I created AmplifyHER in UF's 2024 WingHacks along with my partner Karlina Maya. 

Our website prompts the user to pick an option from a list of preselected genres to give them a new playlist. It filters through a gender database that provides us with information about artists gender identity and made it so that only female, non-binary, and GNC individuals would be added to the generated playlists.

We utilized a combination of JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python in order to create our website. First we used JavaScript and HTML/CSS in order to create the foundation of our website and create a uniformed theme throughout our project. We then utilized python and Spotify's developer API along with Chartmetric's Pronoun and Gender dataset in order generate a playlist that comprised of songs by female, non-binary, and GNC individuals.
